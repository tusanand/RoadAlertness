# Project 4


The aim of the project is to develop the UI of the app. I have worked on creating two activities in the app. One for entering the vitals information and storing it in the database and another showing the list of all recorded vitals. This document depicts the steps required to run the project.


## Steps to run
- The main file is the activity_main.xml.
- The values for respiratory rate, heart rate, reaction time, sleep hours are harcoded as it is a part of my teammates implementation.
- Click on individual buttons for 'Measure Respiratory Rate', 'Measure HeartRate', 'Measure ReactionTime', enter sleep hours.
- Click on the 'Save Record' button to save the entered data
- The 'Recomendation' button shows the recommendation based on the input data. This is non functional in Project 4.
- The 'View Progress' button displays the list of all the saved vitals in card format.
